Project Definition
	
	Project Name: 
	- Geometric morphometric analysis

	Vision: 
	- To use insect wing venation to assist in the taxonomic classification of specimens

	Mission: 
	- To develop a statistical analysis of the geometry of insect wing venation to cluster insects within groups and identify outliers which may hint at new species.

	Success Criteria: 
	-Organise the data in a meaningful way
	-Analyse the landmark coordinates on an insect wing
	-The development of a working statistical analysis
	-Identify morphological range of a species
	-The automation of most of the process after the landarks have been placed
	-Develop a morphometric analysis using python
	-Complete the report
	-Pass the course

Team Agreement

	Behaviour Agreement: 
	- To communicate effectively, to treat everyone fairly, ask for feedback and take onboard comments, embrace change.

	Communication Agreement: 
	- Communicate via email when necessary for client. Use slack for colleagues within MedSci 736.
	- Meet when it canâ€™t be covered in email and have a clear scope for the meeting. Email client once a week regarding progress to date and any working software.
	- If there are issues with the course I will contact the course coordinator or a demonstrator via slack and vice versa
	- If there is an issue with the project I will contact Greg via email and vice versa.
